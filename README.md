# summarizetaskview


Way to quickly summarize info from a task view (or other list of packages)

This was inspired by [Jonathan Chang's post](https://jonathanchang.org/blog/what-r-package-for-phylogenetics-is-the-most-popular/) about downloads for different phylogenetics-related R packages as well as my long term curiosity about how packages in our area. It was also (I now realize after [MaÃ«lle Salmon's](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon) tweet about this, inspired by this [rOpenSci hackathon project, packagemetrics](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/packagemetrics)). It depends on [goodpractice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/goodpractice/vignettes/goodpractice.html) (thanks to [Auriel Fournier](https://twitter.com/RallidaeRule) for pointing to that package) and also uses the packages crandb, cranlogs, ggplot2, lubridate, ctv, packagemetrics, and parallel.
